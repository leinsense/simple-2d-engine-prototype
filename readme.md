# Simple 2D Engine Prototype (WinAPI + GDI)

This is a minimal 2D engine prototype built using pure WinAPI and GDI.  
Created to explore delta time, frame locking, and FPS measurement in a manual game loop.

### Features:
- Manual game loop (`PeekMessage`)
- High-precision delta time (`QueryPerformanceCounter`)
- Smart FPS counter and frame limiter
- Arrow key movement control
- Basic rendering using GDI (`FillRect`, `TextOut`)

### Purpose:
For learning and experimentation with low-level Windows game programming.
